   <p class="middle">My name is William Curtis Brown and I currently work for <a href="http://www.eaton.com">Eaton Corporation</a>, automotive division. A supercharger is an air pump that is used mostly on internal combustion engines. I currently work for Eaton corporation which is the leader in the manufacturing of the Roots style superchargers for OEM applications. The picture below is one of our products that resides on the top of the last Ford GT mid-engine supercar. 
A roots supercharger is a belt driven air pump. It has two rotors that mesh inside to create a fan. The rotors are the same size and do not compress the air within the supercharger like the twin screw type, which is popular for aftermarket applications and currently famous on the new Hellcat hemi engines. The roots blowers are cheaper to manufacture and are more efficient because they do not generate as much heat as their competition. 
A supercharger is a great way to add power to a combustion engine. It takes some power away from the engine by using the belt to drive it but returns power and torque immediately from the line without lag. The power it adds is roughly double what it takes away to run it so the net outcome is positive. Many of our domestic and European car producers prefer the supercharger over turbos for multiple reasons including packaging size, cost, and lack of lag. Some examples of superchargers in the field would include the Corvette ZR1 and Z06, Camaro ZL1, Cadillac CTS-V, Jaguar Type F, and many land rover models.
